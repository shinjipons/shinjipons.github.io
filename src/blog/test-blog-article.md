One East Frisian who can proudly talk about her region's unique tea tradition is Celia Brandenburger, who was raised in East Frisia and is the director of the local tea museum in Leer, a quiet town of cobbled streets close to the Dutch border. For her, the black tea served in a small porcelain cup decorated with an elaborate rose blossom is much more than just a beverage that warms her on a cold, grey morning. Rather, she says, tea is brewed to create a unique atmosphere. It's a tea ceremony for all the senses.

To begin the ceremony, Brandenburger put a piece of rock sugar – or Kluntje – in the bottom of a cup. As she poured the tea, it produced a strong aroma followed by a soft, crackling sound as it hit the sugar. She then scooped some thick cream onto a silver spoon and circled the cup's inner rim, letting the cream gently slide in. She did this anti-clockwise, "so as to stop the passing of time".

What came next was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spectacle: the cream sank to the bottom but then quickly bubbled up, creating an effect that locals call "Wulkje", which means small clouds. These clouds slowly came together and formed a white layer of cream, which is meant to remain on the surface. The tea must not be stirred, Brandenburger warned, so that it can be tasted in three phases.
