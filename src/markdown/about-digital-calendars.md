# About Digital Calendars

Recently I have been thinking about changing calendar apps. Up until now, I have been using Apple Calendar which was adequate but I have been complaining how the lack of a proper Windows desktop client has been a problem.

Yes, I know that Outlook Calendar can support iCloud but after spending two hours figuring out that I had to not use my Apple ID email to get it to work and that I was still having other issues that I will get into later, I decided to look for an alternative.

# My requirements

I am not a very busy guy but I rely on my digital calendar to keep track of few meetings, job interviews, appointments and other life events that I do not want to forget.

I'm a Windows user with an iPhone. My MacBook Pro from 2015 is collecting dust. I need a solution that works on both Windows and iPhone. Browser based solutions are acceptable for Windows but native apps are much preferred.

Here are my requirements:
- Cross platform, Windows and iOS as a bare minimum
- No ads
- No subscription
- Free/busy status embedded into events
- Repeating events
- Events can be shared with other people
- Adding events such as official holidays and sports events (Premier League, F1)

# The problems

Apple Calendar and Google Calendar are the main options. They are both popular and solid options but they are not perfect for me.

Apple Calendar offers a very poor experience for Windows users, perhaps willingly so. The web app is decent but nothing out of the ordinary.
